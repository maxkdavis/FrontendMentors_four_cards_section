# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section solution

This is a solution to the [Four card feature section challenge on Frontend Mentor]

### Overview

This was my first challenge with Front Mentor. I choose a 'newbie' project that focused primarily on HTML & CSS only.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://maxkdavis.github.io/FrontendMentors_four_cards_section/]

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Setting up an HTML structure is relatively straightforward, but semantic HTML takes careful consideration and conventions. I learned that it's easier to strucutre your page first before getting into the details of stlying. Understanding CSS units, the box model and the flexbox module are crucial.
