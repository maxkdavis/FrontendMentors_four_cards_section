## My process

I relied primarily on sematic HTML and CSS for styling (as well as Flexbox for most of the layout). I used Javascript's eventListener function in order to display a social-banner when the user clicks on the share icon.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS - Flexbox

### What I learned

Setting up an HTML structure is relatively straightforward, but semantic HTML takes careful consideration and conventions.
I learned that it's easier to structure your page first before styling.
Understanding CSS units, the box model and the flexbox module are crucial to keeping our contents structured and organized.
